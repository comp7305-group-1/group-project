# Unravel the Mysteries by Spark

## Project Description

Mysteries and supenses are the key elements of a crime fiction or movie.  Inside the story, the person behind the crime scene always intentionally leave some clueless-clues there for keep playing the psychological games with the investigator in-charge. **Mystery text** is always the only clue that may uncover the motives, and may allow the investigator to guess what is the next action details of the case. Here is the sample of Mystery Text:

`FSASYAOFBFOTCANNCILADTTPTAMACE`
`NWAEIAGCWTWTNOANSCASDCLE`

As long as we know more about the background and details of such mysterious text, like where it was cited from, the author background, the context of the original story or the original message, etcâ€¦ we may able to understand the motives. then reconstruct the crime scenes and narrow down the investigation areas.

With the project, the investigator could make use of the program developed to quickly identify whether the "mystery text" seems to be an English intialism or not. If it does cite from somewhere, track the source of the "Quote".

## Pros

- Input the mystery text and track the source of the quote in mins;
- Different data inputs could be incorporated, such as Wikipedia and Project Gutenberg (and maybe Bible) in order to improve the chances of mystery text resolution.

## Cons

- Resolve the mystery text constructed by Initialism as the first target.

## Software to be Installed

- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Spark
- Spark-SQL
- Web Server for serving the frontend UI

## Datasets to be Used

- English Wikipedia (JSON dump, https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/cirrussearch/current/)
- Project Gutenberg public-domain English texts (ftp://mirrors.pglaf.org/mirrors/gutenberg-iso)
- Bible in Basic English (https://www.o-bible.com/dlb.html)
